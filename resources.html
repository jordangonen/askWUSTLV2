        <b>The First Year Center</b>: is an excellent place to find
        orientation, school programs, and events. The site is a good
        resource for helping you find what it will be like moving in
        on the big day. In addition, the first year center is responsible
        for planning on campus housing. They oversee the arrangement of housing
        for freshmen and sophomores living on the South 40 as well for Juniors
        and Seniors living in the Village. For International students, the first
        year center provdies programming resources as well as special living arrangements.
        The lofts are often used to house international students and are located
        on the Delmar Loop. This is the perfect location: surrounded by a number of
        cultural cuisines and markets and is great for immersing yourself in the city.
        Lastly, the First Year Center is responsible for ensuring that students
        have all of their proper information filled out before coming to campus.
        They have lots more information on their website.

        <b>The Club Directory</b>: located on the Student Union's website is one of the best
        resources for finding opportunities on campus. The directory lists the over
        three hundred clubs that we have here on campus: ranging from books and basketball
        to water polo to angler's club, Washington University offers a diverse mix
        of opportunities to get involved. There are a number of acapella groups, frisbee clubs,
        and even a culinary club. The site also lists contact information for how
        to go about getting invovled in the club, making it really easy to find your niche
        early on. We recommend checking out the site before the activities fair so you
        can get a good idea of where to be looking on Mudd Field come fall/spring.
